I did this Project (my first ever game) only by watching Week0 of CS50X Course. 
I watched 3 Scratch Tutorials (but didnt copy/paste)
And my friend @RickStoner helped me to understand how to find Bugs and how Gamelogic works <3

Huge Shoutout to my new Friend @RickStoner from Canada who helped me alot understanding the Fundermentals of Programming and Scratch (but he didnt tell me Solutions, so he was a good Teacher)
